## 📦 How It Works

1. User enters a **city name** into the search bar.
2. The app calls the **OpenWeatherMap API**:

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={your_api_key}&units=metric

3. The response is parsed, and data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description is displayed dynamically on the page.
